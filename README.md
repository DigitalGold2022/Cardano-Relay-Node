Our team is in the process of setting up a Cardano relay node to support our decentralized applications (dApps). This involves configuring a simpler relay node rather than a full block-producing node, which will connect to the Cardano network capable of processing native tokens. The setup includes ensuring familiarity with operating a Cardano node, following detailed instructions to start the node, and connecting it to the appropriate network environment, such as the native token pre-production environment (PPE) or the Cardano mainnet. This relay node will facilitate efficient communication and data relay between our dApps and the Cardano blockchain, ensuring seamless operation and interaction with the network.
